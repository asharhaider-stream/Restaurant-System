- Designed for **future AI chatbot integration, voice assistant, and automation**  

## Tech Stack
- **Flutter (Dart)** for mobile development  
- **MVVM Architecture** with features structured as models, view, view_model, and repository

- **API-ready design** for future backend integration  
- **SRC folder** for shared resources: assets, routing, services, theme, utils, widgets  

## Project Status
🚧 **Under active development**  
- Customer App UI is mostly built  
- Remaining screens (forgot password, empty states, notifications, profile editing) are pending visualization and implementation  
- Backend integration, AI features, and multi-device support are planned  

## Future Scope
- AI-powered chatbot for customer interaction via n8n  
- Smart food recommendations
